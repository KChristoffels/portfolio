# portfolio

1. I'm planning on adding some visual/audio elements to among other things the portfolio picture.
Having it slide into the screen from the side Ã  la the James Bond movie opener.

2. Experiment a bit with color schemes and perhaps I'll find a style which suits me better.

3. Next week's evaluation by the outside company might provide me with some alternative ideas.

4. Add a personal story.
